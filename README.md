# GatewayService

The GatewayService serves as the single entry point to two key services: LeakTestService and TestObjectService. It acts as a unified access point for the rest of the backend.

This service was initially developed as part of a larger school project in collaboration with Nolek. The project's objective was to create a prototype application that companies could use to store and retrieve data related to leak tests on various objects.
